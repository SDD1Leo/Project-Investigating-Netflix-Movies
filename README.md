Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis consists of information about Netflix movies, including title, release year, duration, and genre. The dataset was obtained from netflix_data.csv.
Objective

The main objective of this analysis is to explore whether there is a trend of decreasing movie durations in Netflix's movie library and to identify any patterns or insights regarding movie durations over recent years.
Methodology

    Data Loading and Cleaning: The dataset was loaded into a Python environment and cleaned to remove any inconsistencies or missing values.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Exploratory analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of movie durations, trends over time, and relationships between movie duration and other variables such as genre and release year.
    Statistical Analysis: Statistical tests were performed to determine if there is a significant trend in movie durations over recent years.
    Visualization: Visualizations such as scatter plots were used to illustrate findings and trends.

Results

    Overall, there is a noticeable trend of decreasing movie durations in Netflix's movie library over recent years.
    The trend is consistent across various genres, suggesting a broader industry shift rather than genre-specific preferences.
    Statistical analysis confirms the significance of the observed trend, indicating a systematic decrease in movie durations over time.

Conclusion
